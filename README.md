# Solar_Power_Prediction-WeekTwo
# Description
This project involves data analysis, visualization, and prediction of solar power output using Python and its associated libraries. The dataset is loaded, explored, and visualized to understand the distribution of the data. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained to predict the solar power output. Improvisations include interactive visualizations, customized heatmaps, robust outlier detection, and refined scatter plots.

# Steps Involved
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Exploring the dataset
4. Visualizing the dataset using histograms, scatter plots, and interactive visualizations
5. Preprocessing the data
6. Detecting outliers using robust methods
7. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
8. Training a Random Forest Regressor model
9. Making predictions and evaluating the model
